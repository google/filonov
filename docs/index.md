# Filonov

When dealing with huge amounts of media (video, images, texts) it might be hard
to identify which creative approaches work the best since actual performance is
usually evaluated on a single medium.

## Key features

* **[Fetching media](fetching/overview.md)**: Downloading media info from various sources (i.e. Google Ads)
* **[Tagging media](tagging/overview.md)**: Getting content of each media as a tag.
* **[Finding similar media](similarity/overview.md)**: Find similar media and group them into clusters.
* **[Visualizing media](http://filonov-ai.web.app)**: Ready to use dashboard for understanding media performance on tag, media, and cluster levels.
